 <p style="color:black;">This is badly in need of some TLC!
This program was written pre-2013 while going over A. P. French's
Classical Mechanics. 2022 TODO: write up a little bit about the 
 resonant frequencies, copy the code to khan academy so people can mess with it 
 themselves, and fix the layout so that it's not a full page.</p>
